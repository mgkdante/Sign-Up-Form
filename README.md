https://mgkdante.github.io/Sign-Up-Form/
This is a proof of concept for a sign up page, created by Yesid. The page includes input validation and styling, and is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting started
To view the sign up page, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Usage
The sign up page includes several input fields for the user to enter their information, including first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password. The page includes input validation to ensure that the user enters valid information, and styling to make the page visually appealing and easy to use.

To sign up, the user simply needs to enter their information into the appropriate fields and click the "Sign Up" button. If any of the input fields are invalid, the page will display an error message and highlight the invalid field.
